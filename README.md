Giftr
=============================

Practicing using the Parse API to create an app that allows you to login and create a list of gifts you want.

## Future Plans
+ Private link to share the list with other people or just add emails/usernames.
+ Ability for other people to secretly mark gifts that they have gotten you, or plan to get
+ Shared lists (Useful for registries or just to collaborate on a list)
+ Additional options (color, size, etc...)
+ Yearly verification for each event, to make sure it is up to date
+ Other Stuff Here Again
